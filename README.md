# NavContainerHelperHelper

This collection of scripts, are the ones I use to dumb down the NavContainerHelper scripts. 

# Prerequisites 

You MUST get Freddys NAVContainerHelper first, as these scripts are dependant on those (https://github.com/Microsoft/navcontainerhelper) 

# Am I brilliant?

No - These scripts are just some I hacked together, mostly due to frustration, so I could create new Docker containers myself for a project I was doing. Some inspiration was found in Waldo's scripts (https://github.com/waldo1001/Cloud.Ready.Software.PowerShell). He, unlike me, IS brilliant.

# How I Do Docker

I am running on a Microsoft Surface Book 2, Windows 10 PRO, and enabled Docker CE. I do not run a bunch of containers, so it worked for me.

I have a Projects folder on my C:\ drive - And in there I have a folder for each container I use. I then copy the NavContainerHelperHelper files into the specific folder, and update _Settings.ps1 file
